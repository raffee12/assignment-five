              Question-1: What are the different ways to select an element in

            <p>
              There are various ways to select ways an element in the dom.These
              ways include : document.getElementById,
              document.getElementsByTagName, document.getElementsByClassName,
              document.querySelector etc. Among them "document.getElementById"
              is mostly preferred. "document.querySelector"is also known as css
              selectors. However, to select multiple elements one can use
              "document.querySelectorAll".

              Question-2: What is the difference between innerHTML, innerText,

          <div class="answer-box">
            <p>
              There are subtle but significant differences among innerHTML,
              innerText, and textContent. "innerHTML" gives the text along with
              the tags, while innerText and textContent renders only texts, and
              the textContent respectively. Three of them are useful one must
              know when to use what. For example if someone only want to play
              around with texts then it is better to use " innerText, and
              textContent". if someone want to get the access of both text and
              tags then it is required to innerHTML. "innerHTML" ignores hidden
              elements.

          <div class="answer-box">
            <p>
              event delegation is taking an event from the parent element and
              delegating to its child.This is a very efficient way to control
              codes

            <p>
              when an event is triggered to the child element but its parent
              also got triggered this concept is known by event bubbling.

          <div class="answer-box">
            <p>
              I first creat an element using document.createElement Then add
              necessary contents to it using innerHTML, innerText etc. After
              that I append this on the DOM. To remove elements I simply select
              them using various selecting methods and joint remove() method
              using dot with the selector.
